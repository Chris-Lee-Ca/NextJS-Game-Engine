## Library Folder

This folder provides tools for building a game with Next.js.

Important Note:
None of the modules in this folder should depend on any code from the game folder. Treat the gameEngine folder as a standalone library package, independent of any specific game implementation.

TODO:
Use "npm link" to develop the project, instead of directly import things from gameEngine folder
