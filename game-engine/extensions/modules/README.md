# Module

Module is a type of extension that enhances or adds functionality to an existing plugin.
It acts as a supplementary component,extending the capabilities of the plugin without altering its core behavior.

Modules allow for modular, scalable systems where additional features can be introduced in a decoupled and flexible manner.
